Hello again!

This time this is just a prototype, the idea is a mobile game (for now just Andorid ones) based on touch inputs on screen.

The screen has three invisible colliders, each one has 1/3 of the screen size.

The left one turns the ball: Red

The middle one: Green

And the Right one: Blue

In order to make points, the player has to match the ball color with the wall color

PS: You must run it with a android device conected with your Unity Editor!
